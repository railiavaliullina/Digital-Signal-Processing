## About The Project

The following algorithms were implemented:


### Assignment 1

Calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio;


### Assignment 2

Visualization of spectrogram of a signal (changing the frequency spectrum over time) in the form of an image using the Hanning window;


### Assignment 3

Signal filtering:

         - Implementation of a filter that passes only the specified frequency in the signal,
         - The filter is presented as a combination of FIR and IIR filters,
         - The filter is applied in such a way as to minimize the phase shift,
         - Graphs of the transfer function FIR, IIR and the final filter, spectrograms and graphs of the signal before and after filtering are built.


### Assignment 4

Shifting the signal spectrum to the specified frequency;

         - Using a filter bank to avoid aliasing of shifted copies of the signal spectrum,
         - The comb is a set of bandpass filters + LPF (for the leftmost band) + HPF (for the rightmost band).


### Assignment 5

Implementation of signal demodulation using an analytical signal.

         - The signal contains a bit sequence that needs to be extracted,
         - Using an analytical signal, a sequence of instantaneous signal frequencies is constructed,
         - Based on the received sequence, the transmitted bits are extracted.
